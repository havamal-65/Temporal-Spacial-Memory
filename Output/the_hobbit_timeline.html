course, he gets most of the credit for the present prosperity. They are making songs which say that in his day the rivers run with gold.\u201d \u201cThen the prophecies of the old songs have turned out to be true, after a fashion!\u201d said Bilbo. \u201cOf course!\u201d said Gandalf. \u201cAnd why should not they prove true? Surely you don\u2019t disbelieve the prophecies, because you had a hand in bringing them about yourself? You don\u2019t really suppose, do you, that all your adventures and escapes were managed by mere luck, just for your sole bene-fit? You are a very fine person, Mr. Baggins, and I am very fond of you; but you are only quite a little fellow in a wide world after all!\u201d \u201cThank goodness!\u201d said Bilbo laughing, and handed him the tobacco-jar.
