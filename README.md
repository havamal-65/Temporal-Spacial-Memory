## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- RocksDB
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)
- Environment configuration (see .env.example)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/havamal-65/Temporal-Spacial-Memory.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.query.query_builder import QueryBuilder
from src.query.query_engine import QueryEngine
from src.storage.rocksdb_store import RocksDBStore
from src.graphrag.knowledge_graph import KnowledgeGraph

# Initialize storage and knowledge graph
store = RocksDBStore("path/to/db")
knowledge_graph = KnowledgeGraph(store)

# Create a query engine
engine = QueryEngine(store, knowledge_graph)

# Build and execute a query
result = (QueryBuilder()
    .spatial_within(center=(37.7749, -122.4194), radius=5000)  # meters
    .temporal_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-01-31')
    .knowledge_graph_filter(relation="contains")
    .execute(engine))

# Process results
for item in result:
    print(item)
```
