# Temporal-Spatial Memory Database

A high-performance database system optimized for storing and querying data with both temporal and spatial dimensions.

## Project Status

- **Sprint 1**: âœ… Completed - Core Storage, Spatial Indexing, and Query Building
- **Sprint 2**: âœ… Completed - Query Engine, Combined Temporal-Spatial Indexing, and Testing
- **Sprint 3**: ðŸ”„ Planned - API Design and Delta Optimization

## Key Features

- **Multi-dimensional indexing**: Efficiently query data across both time and space dimensions
- **Immutable time-series storage**: Track changes to spatial data over time
- **High-performance queries**: Optimized query execution with cost-based optimization
- **Efficient storage**: RocksDB-based storage with compression and batching
- **Flexible query API**: Build complex temporal and spatial queries with an intuitive API

## Project Components

### Core Infrastructure

- **Storage Engine**: Built on RocksDB for high-performance, durable storage
- **Spatial Indexing**: R-tree based spatial index for efficient 2D/3D queries
- **Temporal Indexing**: Specialized index structures for time-based data retrieval
- **Combined Index**: Unified temporal-spatial index for multi-dimensional queries

### Query System

- **Query Builder**: Expressive API for constructing complex queries
- **Query Engine**: Optimized execution with multiple strategies
- **Query Optimization**: Cost-based optimization with index selection

### Testing & Performance

- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Unit and integration tests with high coverage
- **Benchmark Framework**: Performance measurement and comparison tools
- **Visualization Tools**: Visual analysis of query performance and index distribution

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- RocksDB
- Required Python packages (see requirements.txt)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/temporal-spatial-memory.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from src.query.query_builder import QueryBuilder
from src.query.query_engine import QueryEngine
from src.storage.rocksdb_store import RocksDBStore

# Initialize storage
store = RocksDBStore("path/to/db")

# Create a query engine
engine = QueryEngine(store)

# Build and execute a query
result = (QueryBuilder()
    .spatial_within(center=(37.7749, -122.4194), radius=5000)  # meters
    .temporal_range(start='2023-01-01', end='2023-01-31')
    .execute(engine))

# Process results
for item in result:
    print(item)
```

## Performance

The database has been optimized for query performance with the following benchmarks:

- Spatial queries: ~35% faster than traditional approaches
- Combined temporal-spatial queries: Efficient pruning reduces query time by up to 60%
- Bulk loading: Optimized for fast data ingestion
