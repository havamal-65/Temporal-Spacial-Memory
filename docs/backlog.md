# Project Backlog

## Current State Assessment

### Core Functionality
- Basic temporal-spatial memory implementation
- Input/Output directory structure
- File organization and management

### Gaps Compared to Commercial Databases

1. **Data Management**
   - Need to implement robust data validation
   - Missing data integrity checks
   - Limited data type support
   - No data compression or optimization

2. **Performance**
   - No query optimization
   - Missing indexing capabilities
   - Limited caching mechanisms
   - No parallel processing support

3. **Security**
   - Missing authentication system
   - No access control mechanisms
   - Limited data encryption
   - No audit logging

4. **Scalability**
   - No distributed system support
   - Limited horizontal scaling
   - Missing load balancing
   - No sharding capabilities

5. **Monitoring & Maintenance**
   - No performance monitoring
   - Missing health checks
   - Limited diagnostic tools
   - No automated maintenance tasks

6. **Documentation**
   - Need comprehensive API documentation
   - Missing user guides
   - Limited code documentation
   - No troubleshooting guides

7. **Testing**
   - Need comprehensive unit tests
   - Missing integration tests
   - Limited performance testing
   - No stress testing

8. **User Interface**
   - No graphical user interface
   - Missing command-line interface
   - Limited configuration options
   - No user preferences management

## Priority Areas for Development

1. **High Priority**
   - Implement data validation and integrity checks
   - Add basic security features
   - Develop comprehensive testing suite
   - Create essential documentation

2. **Medium Priority**
   - Add query optimization
   - Implement basic indexing
   - Develop monitoring tools
   - Create user interface

3. **Low Priority**
   - Implement distributed system support
   - Add advanced security features
   - Develop advanced optimization features
   - Create advanced monitoring tools

## Next Steps

1. Review and prioritize requirements
2. Create detailed technical specifications
3. Develop implementation timeline
4. Set up development milestones
5. Begin implementation of high-priority items

## Notes
- This backlog will be regularly updated as new requirements are identified
- Priorities may shift based on user feedback and project needs
- Each requirement should be broken down into manageable tasks before implementation
