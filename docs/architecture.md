# Temporal-Spatial Knowledge Database Architecture

## Overview

The Temporal-Spatial Knowledge Database is a specialized database system designed for efficiently storing and querying data that has both spatial and temporal dimensions. It enables powerful queries that can combine both aspects, such as "find all knowledge points near location X that occurred during time period Y."

## Core Components

### Node

The fundamental data structure in the system is the `Node`, which represents a point of knowledge in the temporal-spatial continuum. Each node has:

- A unique identifier
- Coordinates in both space and time
- Arbitrary payload data
- References to other nodes
- Metadata

Nodes are immutable, which ensures consistency when traversing historical states. Any modification to a node results in a new node with the updated properties, while preserving the original.

### Coordinate System

The coordinate system supports:

- **Spatial Coordinates**: N-dimensional points in space
- **Temporal Coordinates**: Points in time with precision levels
- **Combined Coordinates**: Integrates both spatial and temporal dimensions

This flexible coordinate system allows for representing diverse types of knowledge, from physical objects with precise locations to abstract concepts with approximate temporal relevance.

## Storage Layer

### Node Store

The storage layer is built around the `NodeStore` interface, which defines operations for persisting and retrieving nodes. The primary implementation is:

- **RocksDBNodeStore**: Uses RocksDB for efficient, persistent storage of nodes

### Serialization

The system includes utilities for serializing and deserializing nodes to and from different formats (JSON, Pickle), allowing for flexible storage and interoperability.

## Indexing Layer

The indexing layer provides efficient access patterns for different query types:

### Spatial Index

Based on the R-tree data structure, the spatial index allows for:
- Finding nearest neighbors to a point
- Performing range queries

### Temporal Index

The temporal index supports:
- Range queries (find all nodes within a time period)
- Nearest time queries (find nodes closest to a specific time)

### Combined Index

The combined index integrates both spatial and temporal indices to support complex queries that involve both dimensions:
- Find all nodes near a specific location within a time period
- Find nodes nearest to both a point in space and a point in time

## Query System

(To be implemented) The query system will provide a user-friendly interface for:
- Spatial queries
- Temporal queries
- Combined spatio-temporal queries
- Complex filters and aggregations

## Delta System

(To be implemented) The delta system will enable:
- Tracking changes over time
- Reconstructing historical states
- Efficient storage of incremental changes

## Design Principles

1. **Immutability**: Core data structures are immutable to ensure consistency
2. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear interfaces between components
3. **Performance**: Optimized for efficient queries in both spatial and temporal dimensions
4. **Flexibility**: Support for various data types and query patterns
5. **Extensibility**: Clear abstractions that allow for adding new features

## Future Extensions

1. **Query Language**: A specialized DSL for temporal-spatial queries
2. **Visualization Tools**: Interactive visualizations of the knowledge space
3. **Stream Processing**: Support for continuous updates and real-time queries
4. **Distribution**: Distributing the database across multiple machines
