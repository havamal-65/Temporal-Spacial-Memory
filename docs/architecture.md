# Temporal-Spatial Memory Database Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Temporal-Spatial Memory Database system, including its components, data flow, and design decisions.

## System Overview

The Temporal-Spatial Memory Database is designed to efficiently store and query data with both temporal (time-based) and spatial (coordinate-based) dimensions. It provides a unified way to track how spatial data changes over time and query these changes efficiently.

## Core Components

### 1. Storage Layer

The storage layer is responsible for persisting data and providing efficient access patterns.

  - Configurable pruning and merging strategies
  - Efficient reconstruction of node states at any point in time
- **Design Decisions**:
  - Hybrid approach combining full snapshots with delta chains
  - Automatic optimization to balance storage efficiency and query performance

### 2. Indexing Layer

The indexing layer provides efficient access patterns for different query types.

#### 2.1 Spatial Index (R-tree)

#### 2.3 Combined Temporal-Spatial Index

- **Purpose**: Optimizes combined queries across both dimensions
- **Features**:
  - Unified query interface for both temporal and spatial criteria
  - Efficient filtering with dimensional pruning
  - Adaptive query planning based on criteria
- **Design Decisions**:
  - Two-phase filtering strategy (filter by most selective dimension first)
  - Dynamic optimization based on query statistics

### 3. Query Layer

The query layer provides a high-level interface for constructing and executing queries.

#### 3.1 Query Builder

### 4. API Layer

The API layer exposes the database functionality over HTTP.

#### 4.1 RESTful API

- **Purpose**: Provides HTTP access to the database
- **Features**:
  - CRUD operations for nodes
  - Query endpoint with filtering and sorting
  - Authentication and authorization
  - OpenAPI documentation
- **Design Decisions**:
  - RESTful design for resource-oriented architecture
  - FastAPI for performance and auto-documentation
  - JWT-based authentication for stateless scaling

#### 4.2 Client SDK

- **Purpose**: Simplifies API interaction from client applications
- **Features**:
  - Connection pooling and request retries
  - Circuit breaker for fault tolerance
  - Type-safe client methods
- **Design Decisions**:
  - Thin client design with smart defaults
  - Abstraction of HTTP details from application code

## Data Flow

### 1. Data Ingestion Flow

1. Client submits data via API or SDK
2. API layer validates and processes the request
3. Storage layer persists the data in RocksDB
4. Delta system records changes if updating existing data
5. Indexing layer updates indices with new data
6. Response is returned to the client

### 2. Query Execution Flow

1. Client submits query via API or SDK
2. Query engine parses and validates the query
3. Query optimizer generates execution plan
4. Appropriate indices are selected based on query criteria
5. Query is executed against the selected indices
6. Results are filtered, sorted, and paginated
7. Formatted results are returned to the client

## Scalability Considerations

The architecture supports horizontal scaling in several ways:

### 1. Read Scaling

- Query caching improves read performance
- Indices can be partitioned for parallel query execution
- Read replicas can be deployed for read-heavy workloads

### 2. Write Scaling

- Efficient delta encoding minimizes write amplification
- Bulk loading capabilities for high-volume ingestion
- Batched write operations for improved throughput

### 3. Storage Scaling

- Delta compression reduces storage requirements
- Configurable pruning strategies for managing storage growth
- Support for distributed storage backends

## Future Extensions

The architecture is designed to support several planned extensions:

### 1. Advanced Query Capabilities

- Graph-based queries for relationship traversal
- Time-travel queries for historical analysis
- Predictive queries using statistical models

### 2. Enhanced Scalability

- Sharded deployment for horizontal scaling
- Distributed query execution
- Tiered storage for hot/cold data separation

### 3. Integration Capabilities

- Change data capture (CDC) for real-time event processing
- Streaming input/output adapters
- Data synchronization with external systems

## Design Principles

The architecture follows these key design principles:

1. **Efficiency**: Optimize for both storage efficiency and query performance
2. **Flexibility**: Support diverse query patterns and data shapes
3. **Extensibility**: Enable easy addition of new features and capabilities
4. **Reliability**: Ensure data integrity and system stability
5. **Usability**: Provide intuitive interfaces for developers
