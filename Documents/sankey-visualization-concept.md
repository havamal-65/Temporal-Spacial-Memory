# Sankey-Inspired Visualization for Knowledge Flow

This document explores how Sankey diagram principles can enhance the visualization of our temporal-spatial knowledge database, creating more intuitive representations of knowledge evolution.

## Sankey Diagrams: Key Principles

Sankey diagrams are flow diagrams where:
- The width of flows represents quantity
- Flows can branch and merge
- The diagram shows how quantities distribute across different paths
- Color can represent different categories or states

These principles align remarkably well with our knowledge structure's needs.

## Knowledge Flow Representation

When visualizing our temporal-spatial knowledge database with Sankey-inspired techniques:

### 1. Flow Width as Information Volume

The width of connections between nodes represents the amount of information flowing between concepts:
- Thicker flows indicate more substantial information transfer
- Core topics have thicker connections than peripheral details
- As knowledge accumulates, flows generally become wider

```javascript
// Pseudocode for calculating flow width
function calculateFlowWidth(sourceNode, targetNode) {
  const baseWidth = 1;
  const informationVolume = calculateInformationContent(sourceNode, targetNode);
  const connectionStrength = getConnectionStrength(sourceNode, targetNode);
  
  return baseWidth * informationVolume * connectionStrength;
}
```

### 2. Temporal Progression as Flow Direction

The main flow direction represents time progression:
- Knowledge flows from earlier to later time periods
- The main axis typically represents temporal progression
- Cross-flows can show relationships between concurrent topics

### 3. Branch Formation as Flow Divergence

Branch formation is visualized as significant flow divergence:
- When a topic exceeds the threshold for branching, a substantial flow diverts
- This divergent flow connects to the new branch center
- The width of the branch flow indicates the amount of information carried to the new branch

```javascript
// Pseudocode for visualizing branch formation
function createBranchFlowPath(originNode, branchCenterNode) {
  const path = new Path();
  const controlPoints = calculateSmoothPath(originNode, branchCenterNode);
  const flowWidth = calculateBranchFlowWidth(originNode, branchCenterNode);
  
  path.setWidth(flowWidth);
  path.setControlPoints(controlPoints);
  path.setGradient(originNode.color, branchCenterNode.color);
  
  return path;
}
```

### 4. Information Density as Node Size

Node size represents information content:
- Larger nodes contain more information
- Core concepts typically have larger nodes
- Nodes grow as they accumulate related information

## Visualization Benefits

The Sankey-inspired approach provides several advantages:

### 1. Intuitive Information Flow

- Visually represents how knowledge moves and evolves
- Makes the flow of information immediately apparent
- Reinforces the temporal narrative of knowledge development

### 2. Focus on Important Paths

- Thicker flows naturally draw attention to important knowledge transfers
- Less significant paths remain visible but don't distract
- Users can visually follow major knowledge evolution

### 3. Branch Visualization

- Branch formation becomes a natural, visible event
- Users can easily see when and why new branches form
- The connection between original and branch knowledge remains clear

### 4. Immediate Relevance Assessment

- Flow thickness provides a visual cue about importance
- Users can quickly identify major knowledge areas
- The relative significance of different paths is immediately apparent

## Interactive Features

A Sankey-inspired visualization can incorporate interactive elements:

### 1. Flow Highlighting

When a user hovers over or selects a flow:
- Highlight the entire path from origin to current position
- Show detailed information about the knowledge transfer
- Emphasize related flows while de-emphasizing others

### 2. Node Expansion

When a user clicks on a node:
- Expand to show constituent knowledge elements
- Display connections to other nodes in detail
- Show the node's complete evolution history

### 3. Temporal Navigation

Interactive controls allow users to:
- Zoom in or out on specific time periods
- Play animations showing knowledge evolution
- Compare different time periods side by side

### 4. Branch Exploration

When exploring branches:
- Show the complete context of branch formation
- Allow navigating between branches while maintaining context
- Provide options to view the original structure, branched structure, or both

## Implementation Approach

To implement Sankey-inspired visualizations for our database:

### 1. Flow Calculation Engine

```javascript
class KnowledgeFlowEngine {
  constructor(knowledgeBase) {
    this.knowledgeBase = knowledgeBase;
    this.flowCache = new Map();
  }
  
  calculateFlows(timeRange, branchIds = ["main"]) {
    const flows = [];
    const timeSlices = this.getTimeSlices(timeRange);
    
    // Calculate flows between consecutive time slices
    for (let i = 0; i < timeSlices.length - 1; i++) {
      const sourceSlice = timeSlices[i];
      const targetSlice = timeSlices[i + 1];
      
      const sliceFlows = this.calculateFlowsBetweenSlices(
        sourceSlice, 
        targetSlice,
        branchIds
      );
      
      flows.push(...sliceFlows);
    }
    
    // Calculate branch formation flows
    const branchFlows = this.calculateBranchFormationFlows(timeRange, branchIds);
    flows.push(...branchFlows);
    
    return flows;
  }
  
  calculateFlowsBetweenSlices(sourceSlice, targetSlice, branchIds) {
    // Implementation details for calculating flows between time slices
  }
  
  calculateBranchFormationFlows(timeRange, branchIds) {
    // Implementation details for calculating branch formation flows
  }
}
```

### 2. Rendering Engine

```javascript
class SankeyKnowledgeRenderer {
  constructor(canvas, flowEngine) {
    this.canvas = canvas;
    this.flowEngine = flowEngine;
    this.colorScheme = new ColorScheme();
  }
  
  render(timeRange, branchIds, options = {}) {
    const flows = this.flowEngine.calculateFlows(timeRange, branchIds);
    const nodes = this.collectNodesFromFlows(flows);
    
    // Layout calculation
    const layout = this.calculateLayout(nodes, flows, options);
    
    // Render nodes
    for (const node of layout.nodes) {
      this.renderNode(node);
    }
    
    // Render flows
    for (const flow of layout.flows) {
      this.renderFlow(flow);
    }
    
    // Render branch formations
    for (const branchFlow of layout.branchFlows) {
      this.renderBranchFlow(branchFlow);
    }
  }
  
  // Various rendering methods
  renderNode(node) { /* ... */ }
  renderFlow(flow) { /* ... */ }
  renderBranchFlow(branchFlow) { /* ... */ }
  
  // Layout calculation
  calculateLayout(nodes, flows, options) { /* ... */ }
}
```

### 3. Interaction Handler

```javascript
class SankeyInteractionHandler {
  constructor(renderer, knowledgeBase) {
    this.renderer = renderer;
    this.knowledgeBase = knowledgeBase;
    this.selectedElements = new Set();
  }
  
  setupEventListeners() {
    this.renderer.canvas.addEventListener('click', this.handleClick.bind(this));
    this.renderer.canvas.addEventListener('mousemove', this.handleHover.bind(this));
    // More event listeners...
  }
  
  handleClick(event) {
    const element = this.findElementAtPosition(event.x, event.y);
    if (element) {
      this.selectElement(element);
    }
  }
  
  handleHover(event) {
    const element = this.findElementAtPosition(event.x, event.y);
    if (element) {
      this.highlightElement(element);
    }
  }
  
  // More interaction methods...
  selectElement(element) { /* ... */ }
  highlightElement(element) { /* ... */ }
  findElementAtPosition(x, y) { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Conclusion

Sankey-inspired visualizations offer an intuitive and powerful way to represent the temporal-spatial knowledge database. By representing information as flowing through time, with width indicating volume and branching showing concept divergence, this approach makes complex knowledge structures more accessible and understandable.

The combination of our coordinate-based structure with Sankey visualization principles creates a unique and powerful tool for exploring, understanding, and communicating knowledge evolution across domains.
