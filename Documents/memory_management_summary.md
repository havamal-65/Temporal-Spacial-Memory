# Memory Management in Temporal-Spatial Database

This document provides an overview of the memory management strategies implemented in the Temporal-Spatial Memory Database, as demonstrated in the simplified example.

## Overview

The Temporal-Spatial Memory Database deals with large datasets that may not fit entirely in memory. To address this challenge, we've implemented several memory management strategies:

1. **Partial Loading**: Only load nodes that are actively being used
2. **Memory Monitoring**: Track memory usage and apply garbage collection when needed
3. **Caching Strategies**: Optimize access to frequently used nodes

## Implementation Components

### SimpleNode

A lightweight representation of knowledge points with:
- Unique ID
- Timestamp for temporal positioning
- Spatial coordinates
- Content data
- Connections to other nodes

### SimpleNodeStore

Persistent storage for nodes that:
- Stores all nodes, regardless of memory constraints
- Provides efficient retrieval by ID
- Supports querying by temporal and spatial attributes

### SimplePartialLoader

Memory management layer that:
- Loads nodes on-demand from the store
- Tracks access patterns for nodes
- Implements garbage collection to free memory when limits are reached
- Evicts least recently used nodes first

### SimpleCache

Caching layer that:
- Provides faster access to frequently used nodes
- Implements an LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction policy
- Tracks cache hit/miss statistics

## Memory Management Strategies

### Garbage Collection

When memory limits are reached, the system:
1. Identifies least recently accessed nodes
2. Evicts a percentage of these nodes (10% in the example)
3. Maintains tracking information for potential future access

### Query Optimization

The system optimizes memory usage during queries by:
1. Loading only nodes that match query criteria
2. Caching frequently accessed results
3. Using streaming result patterns for large result sets

## Performance Considerations

The example demonstrates:
- Efficient handling of 10,000+ nodes with only 1,000 nodes in memory
- Automatic garbage collection to maintain memory limits
- Cache hit rates improving with repeated access patterns

## Usage Examples

The simplified example demonstrates:
1. **Temporal Window Queries**: Retrieving nodes within specific time ranges
2. **Spatial Region Queries**: Retrieving nodes within specific spatial coordinates
3. **Cache Performance Testing**: Evaluating the effectiveness of caching

## Implementation Benefits

This approach offers several advantages:
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Works with datasets larger than available memory
- **Automatic Resource Management**: No manual memory handling required
- **Optimization for Access Patterns**: Frequently accessed nodes stay in memory
- **Scalability**: Performance remains stable as dataset size increases

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to this memory management approach include:
- Predictive loading based on access patterns
- Multi-level caching strategies
- Distributed memory management across multiple systems
- Custom eviction policies based on node importance

## Conclusion

The memory management strategies demonstrated in the simplified example provide a foundation for handling large temporal-spatial datasets efficiently. By implementing partial loading, automatic garbage collection, and caching, the database can work with datasets larger than available memory while maintaining good performance characteristics.
