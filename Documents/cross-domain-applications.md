## Common Value Factors Across Domains

All these applications benefit from the temporal-spatial database's core capabilities:

1. **Relationship Preservation**: Maintaining connections between related concepts even as they evolve
2. **Temporal Context**: Preserving the historical context of information and decisions
3. **Navigational Efficiency**: Enabling efficient traversal of complex knowledge structures
4. **Organic Knowledge Growth**: Supporting natural evolution and branching of knowledge areas
5. **Multi-Scale Representation**: Providing both detailed and high-level views of knowledge structures

These applications demonstrate that the temporal-spatial knowledge database concept addresses fundamental challenges in knowledge representation across diverse domains, making it a broadly applicable approach rather than a specialized solution for AI systems.
