# Temporal-Spatial Memory Database Project Planning

This directory contains planning documents for the Temporal-Spatial Memory Database MVP development.

## Documents

- **[sprint_plan.md](sprint_plan.md)**: Overall sprint planning document with 6 sprints outlined
- **[sprint_task_tracker.md](sprint_task_tracker.md)**: Template for tracking individual sprint progress
- **[sprint1_tasks.md](sprint1_tasks.md)**: Detailed breakdown of Sprint 1 tasks

## MVP Implementation Plan

This project follows the detailed MVP completion plan outlined in [../mvp_completion_plan.xml](../mvp_completion_plan.xml), which provides a structured approach to implementing the remaining features needed for a production-ready MVP.

## Sprint Structure

Each sprint is designed to be 1-2 weeks long, with a focus on delivering specific components:

1. **Sprint 1**: Core Query Module and Storage
2. **Sprint 2**: Query Execution and Testing
3. **Sprint 3**: API Design and Delta Optimization
4. **Sprint 4**: Caching and Memory Management
5. **Sprint 5**: Client Interface and Documentation
6. **Sprint 6**: Packaging, Quality, and Finalization

## Usage

To track a sprint's progress:

1. Copy the `sprint_task_tracker.md` template
2. Rename it to `sprintN_tracker.md` (where N is the sprint number)
3. Fill in the relevant details for the sprint
4. Update daily during stand-up meetings
5. Conduct a retrospective at the end of the sprint

## Metrics

The following metrics will be tracked for each sprint:

- Planned vs. completed tasks
- Estimated vs. actual hours
- Test coverage percentage
- Performance benchmarks
- Bug count (found/fixed)

## Dependencies

The critical path for development is:

1. Query Module → Query Execution Engine → Query Optimization
2. RocksDB Integration → Caching Layer → Memory Management
3. Public API → Client Interface → Package Distribution
