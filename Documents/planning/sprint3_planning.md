## Technical Design Considerations

### API Design
1. **RESTful Structure**
   - Resource-oriented API design
   - Use of proper HTTP methods and status codes
   - Consistent response formats

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Efficient payload design
   - Connection pooling and keep-alive
   - Caching strategies

3. **Security Measures**
   - JWT-based authentication
   - Role-based access control
   - Input sanitization and validation

### Delta Optimization
1. **Storage Efficiency**
   - Binary delta encoding
   - Compression algorithms selection
   - Optimal chunk sizing

2. **Retrieval Performance**
   - Index-aware delta retrieval
   - Lazy loading strategies
   - Predictive prefetching

3. **Consistency and Durability**
   - Atomic delta updates
   - Consistent snapshots
   - Backup and recovery strategies

## Deliverables
1. Complete API with documentation
2. Python client SDK
3. Optimized delta storage implementation
4. Example applications
5. Performance benchmarks for delta operations

## Success Criteria
1. API latency under 50ms for 99% of requests
2. Delta storage reduces space requirements by at least 40%
3. Delta query performance comparable to direct storage access
4. Comprehensive documentation coverage
5. 90% test coverage for all new components

## Dependencies
- Completed query execution engine (Sprint 2)
- Combined indexing implementation (Sprint 2)
- Core storage and retrieval mechanisms (Sprint 1)

## Risk Assessment
- **Risk**: API design may not cover all use cases
  - **Mitigation**: Conduct thorough requirements gathering and user interviews
  
- **Risk**: Delta optimization may introduce data consistency issues
  - **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive testing for edge cases and recovery scenarios
  
- **Risk**: Performance targets may be challenging to meet
  - **Mitigation**: Early performance testing and profiling to identify bottlenecks

## Planning Notes
- API design workshop scheduled for day 1 of the sprint
- Consider leveraging FastAPI for quick API development
- Need to coordinate with UX team for documentation design
- Consider bringing in performance specialist for delta optimization

## Post-Sprint Planning
- Prepare for Sprint 4: Production Deployment and Monitoring
- Plan for user acceptance testing
- Prepare training materials for internal teams
